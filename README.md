crt-mod
=======

Project to modify the CRISPR Recognition Tool and related wrapper in order to make the code more usable in more environments. Also, a major goal may be adding the ability to specify databases to match against, which is a slightly different function than this tool is focused on.

## crt-jar ##
CRT (from [it's creators](http://www.room220.com/crt/)) only has a Windows executable for the GUI. This is a compiled jar that should work on any modern Java Platform. Grab it from [crt-jar/crt-gui.jar](crt-jar/crt-gui.jar).
